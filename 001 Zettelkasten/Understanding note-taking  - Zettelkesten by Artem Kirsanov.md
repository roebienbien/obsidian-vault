## There is two things in management you should prioritize:
1. Time 
	- Because we have too little of it.
2. Knowledge 
	-  Because we have too much of it around us.

We consume knowledge more than ever before but some of us don't have the system to store these gained insights properly, Some just hope that information magically sticks to our brain.

## Zettelkasten
- A note taking system that is surging in popularity in recent years.

## Niklas Luhmann
- Niklas Luhmann is one of the most influential social scientiests of 20th century
- Niklas wrote 60 books and 100 articles by using his own system of note-taking
- Luhmann unique system of note-taking was when he got and idea he get a 3x5 card and wrote the idea on it, Where one card is equals to 1 atomic idea.
- He never copy the exact phrase of what he read but filter it through his own thinking in rephrase it in his own words where can understand it easily.
- When finishing writing on the card Luhmann give the card a unique id, 
	- for example 
		1. 7b89 "When creating a Zettelkasten card, don't copy the content, use your own words."
		2. 3ac7 "Feynman technique: Explaining something in simple terms help you to better understand it."
		3. 61a3 "Interlinking of ideas helps to build abstractions and develop deeper understanding of general principles."
- Then he add id's of card to another cards setting a linkages of ideas 

## Three Pillars of Zettelkasten

One of the strength of Zettelkasten is it is not bound by the initial architecture a top-down method of note-taking  . Traditional note-taking suggests that you separate ideas by different file and those file can be put on a new folder with the same topics/themes. but sometimes a single file can cover multiple topics.

### 1. Fluid Structure
	1.1 Emergent
### 2. Interlinking
	- Zettelkasten strength lies in ideas linking 
### 3. Externalization
	- Using feynman technique, externalize your knowledge of an idea by simulation whereas your teaching it to someone who have a vaguely understanding of the topic.
