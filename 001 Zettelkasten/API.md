# Application Programming Interface
**Application Programming Interface** (_API_) is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other. API are an accessible way to extract and share data within and across organizations.

## How do APIs work?
APIs are mechanisms that enable two software components to communicate with each other using a set of definitions and protocols. For example, the weather bureau’s software system contains daily weather data. The weather app on your phone “talks” to this system via APIs and shows you daily weather updates on your phone.

## Four different APIs
1. ![[SOAP-API#SOAP-API]]
2. ![[RPC-API#RPC-API]]
3. ![[websocket-API#websocket-API]]
4. ![[REST-API#Representational State Transfer (REST)]]
