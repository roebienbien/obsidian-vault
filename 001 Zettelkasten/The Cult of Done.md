# The Cult of Done

## Three states of being
 1. Not knowing
Not Knowing is the initial stage where you are unaware or lack knowledge about something. It could be a problem, a task, a skill, or any situation. This stage is characterized by ignorance, uncertainty, and curiosity.
 2. Action
Action, This is where you learn, explore, work, or take steps to change your state of knowing. It involves effort, struggle, practice, and nearly always, MISTAKES.
 3. Completion
Completion is the final stage where the task or process is finished or the problem is solved. The state of not knowing has been transformed into knowledge or skill through your action.

These three states are cyclical and continuous: after completion, you have a better understanding of the problem, and you very likely have ideas about how to do it again better next time.

## Accept that everything is a Draft: It helps to get it done.
Prototypes make it to production, quick sketches become long-term plans, and things you write down to get them out of your head end up in the final, published book.

**What you're doing is just a draft, it doesn't have to be perfect, it never will be, even after it's done.**

## There is no Editing stage

Painting has no editing, if you make a mistake YOU START AGAIN. Performing music has no editing, if you make a mistake you keep going and hope the audience didn't notice. And Pottery has no editing, if it comes out of the kiln and you don't like it, smash it to pieces and start again.

This principle models the way the world actually works. When you release something into the world, be it a book or a program language, you've lost control of it, in a very big way.

**Learn to accept this. Don't tweak what you've got, make another one.**

## Fake it 'till you make it
Pretending you know what you're doing is almost the same as knowing what you are doing, So just accept that you know what you're doing even if you don't and DO IT.
