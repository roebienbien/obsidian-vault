# HTML DOM

The **Document Object Model** (_DOM_) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web

When a web page is rendered, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.

JavaScript can access the DOM to create a dynamic HTML:
- JavaScript can change all the HTML elements in the page
- JavaScript can change all the HTML attributes in the page
- JavaScript can change all the CSS styles in the page
- JavaScript can remove existing HTML elements and attributes
- JavaScript can add new HTML elements and attributes
- JavaScript can react to all existing HTML events in the page
- JavaScript can create new HTML events in the page


## What is the DOM?
- The DOM is a W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standard.
- The DOM defines a standard for accessing documents:

>"The W3C Document Object Model (DOM)  is a platform and language-neural interface that allows programs and scripts to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of a document."

The W3C DOM consists of 3 parts:
1. Core DOM - standard model for all document types
2. XML DOM - standard model for [[XML]] documents
3. HTML DOM - standard model for [[HTML]] documents

>**In other words: The HTML DOM is a standard how to get, change, add, and delete HTML elements**
